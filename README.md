# RDD

## Motivation

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to work with RDD.
Even though working with bare RDD are mostly frown up,
it remains the essential building block of all Apache Spark's modules,
so knowing it is important.

# Preparation

Open the notebook:

- Start the container (feel free to use the detached mode `-d`): `docker compose up`
- Wait for the container to start
- Retrieve the jupyter: url `bash ./guess_jupyter_url`
- Open the url in a web browser
- Navigate to the file browser panel. Press `CTRL + SHIFT + F` if it's not visible
- Double click on `notebooks/01-RDD.ipynb`
